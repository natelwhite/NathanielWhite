## project background
- I built this site for a digital artist who had a particular vision which they could not achieve using website builders like Wix/Weebly.
- I continue to maintain the site when the artist is looking to make significant changes, but they've been able to handle minor changes in the HTML on their own.
- Since the client is a small-time artist, I looked to remove as much cost from the site as possible. After considering what the client wanted to do with their site, I was able to widdle down the costs to just the domain name.
